# Tshet-uinh Autoderiver 切韻音系自動推導器

Tshet-uinh Autoderiver is an online tool that automatically generates phonological reconstructions of the Tshet-uinh phonological system, as well as extrapolated historical and modern phonological systems derived from it.

This tool is part of the nk2028 organisation’s suite of computational linguistics projects, which aim to advance research in historical Chinese phonology and beyond.

## Try It Online

The tool is available as a web-based interface at <https://nk2028.shn.hk/tshet-uinh-autoderiver/>.

## How It Works

Tshet-uinh Autoderiver uses [TshetUinh.js](https://github.com/nk2028/tshet-uinh-js) as its underlying library, which provides the computational framework for deriving phonological systems. By leveraging this JavaScript-based library, the tool is capable of handling a wide range of reconstructions, extrapolations, and creative phonological experiments.

The interface is user-friendly and allows for instant results without requiring advanced technical knowledge. However, for users with programming experience, the tool can be extended by modifying or adding derivation scripts, with the examples in the [tshet-uinh-examples](https://github.com/nk2028/tshet-uinh-examples) repository serving as a helpful reference.
